	<p>Once upon a time, I was an agile coach. I was a scrum master for multiple engineering teams at a few different companies and led an organization-wide agile transformation at a SaaS startup. I also spent some time trying to teach myself to code on the side as a way to supplement my job skills. </p>

	<p>Eventually, I realized that I wanted to pursue coding as a career itself rather than just a career-enhancing skill. I'm now a full-time student at the Turing School of Software Design.</p>

	<p>When I'm not working, I race distances from 5Ks to <a href="http://running.competitor.com/2013/05/saucony-26-strong/team10_75373">marathons</a></p>
