Sort of.

This week marks the end of the my first module at Turing School. The program here is divided into four six-week modules, the first one focusing entirely on Ruby fundamentals. When I first started six weeks ago, I could write the classic hello-world program and not much else.

Today, a classmate and I are turning in a [project](https://github.com/marlabrizel/sales_engine) where we hand-built a relational database.

It's kind of amazing what you can learn in a short stretch of time.

Now, don't get me wrong. Learning to program is *hard*. It's not like I walked into school six weeks ago, went to a few classes, rolled in some fairy dust, and came out a developer. There were (many) late nights, lots of error messages, and more tears than I'd like to admit. I'm still not a developer, at least not yet as far as employability goes. But six weeks of hard work have left me with an ability to navigate through and use error messages to my advantage. I can reason about code and even pick out ways to improve what I've written. Best of all, I can help others with their code.

I'm only six weeks into a life-long educational journey. I can't wait to see what the next six weeks hold.
