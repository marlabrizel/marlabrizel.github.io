<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hat is failure?</p>

I've always been pretty "good" at school. This trait is pretty common among
Turing students: we're used to working hard and we've enjoyed the
correlation between hard work and favorable results. And this concept
generally holds pretty true for most academic pursuits: study like crazy, get
an A.

When I started at Turing, I assumed things would be the same. And when I got
my first project, I applied the same mentality: I worked really, really hard.
The project was also really, really hard. But I worked my butt off.

I failed the first project.

The project assignment was to build an [Enigma
Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine). My code encrypted
messages, it decrypted them, it even (mostly) cracked them. It was well-organized and followed SRP. I wasn't super sure what it meant for the code to be well-tested, so I gave that part my best shot.

The test coverage sucked. And so, I failed the first project.

Later, I would start to understand the vital role that failure plays in
learning how to program. I honestly can't really remember much about my
thought process during that first project, but I do know how much time I've
spent thinking about testing since then. On subsequent projects, I
consistently scored the highest on testing. And now, I honestly can't
imagine how I would implement features in Rails without first writing a
really solid integration test to guide me.

programming.</blockquote>

You'll learn far more from the failures, and the subsequent struggle to
learn, than from randomly stumbling upon the right answer. You'll dive
deeper into the subject matter and build a more solid understanding of how a
particular piece works. And most importantly, you'll learn that there's no such
thing as an "A" grade in programming, or a finish line. Learning to program
is an ongoing endeavor, one in which there are bound to be mistakes and
hiccups. The process is never-ending, and that's what makes it so rewarding.
