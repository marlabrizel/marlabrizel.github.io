<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>llow me to introduce myself.</p>

I'm Marla and this blog is an attempt to chronicle my foray into software development.

Lifted from my About Me:

<blockquote>Once upon a time, I was an agile coach. I was a scrum master for multiple engineering teams at a few different companies and led an organization-wide agile transformation at a SaaS startup. I also spent some time trying to teach myself to code on the side as a way to supplement my job skills. Eventually, I realized that I wanted to pursue coding as a career itself rather than just a career-enhancing skill. I'm now a full-time student at the Turing School of Software Design. </blockquote>

Hang out for a while. We'll reflect on what it's like to be a code n00b when everyone else around you already seems to know what the heck they're doing. We'll write some code and maybe even talk about life away from the computer every now and then.
